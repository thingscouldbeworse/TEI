    <heading>The Mystery</heading>
    <stanza>
        <line>I was not; now I am—a few days hence</line>
        <line>I shall not be; I fain would look before</line>
        <line>And after, but can neither do; some Power</line>
        <line>Or lack of power says “no” to all I would.</line>
        <line> I stand upon a wide and sunless plain,</line>
        <line> Nor chart nor steel to guide my steps aright.</line>
        <line> Whene’er, o’ercoming fear, I dare to move,</line>
        <line> I grope without direction and by chance.</line>
        <line> Some feign to hear a voice and feel a hand</line>
        <line> That draws them ever upward thro’ the gloom.</line>
        <line> But I—I hear no voice and touch no hand,</line>
        <line> Tho’ oft thro’ silence infinite I list,</line>
        <line> And strain my hearing to supernal sounds;</line>
        <line> Tho’ oft thro’ fateful darkness do I reac</line>h,
        <line> And stretch my hand to find that other hand,</line>
        <line> I question of th’ eternal bending skies</line>
        <line> That seem to neighbor with the novice earth;</line>
        <line> But they roll on, and daily shut their eyes</line>
        <line> On me, as I one day shall do on them,</line>
        <line> And tell me not the secret that I ask.</line>
